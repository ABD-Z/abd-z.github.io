					About my logo
				</h2>
				<hr>
				<div class="section_content">
					<p>
						<b>TL;DR : </b> my logo is my first name written in Arabic in square kufic calligraphy style.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						When I began to make my website, I thought of designing a logo, something unique and refined
						that would fit easily in any graphical charter and look mysterious to the visitor.
						<br>
						I thought first of making my signature as my logo because when I used to sign infront of people
						I oftenly got positive feedback (especially from women surprisingly) on how my signature
						looks unique and smooth with its curves and how I write it down from right to left. Yes, you get
						it : my signature is my first name in Arabic letters, not in Latin, which make it exotic and
						intriguing at the same time for a Western audiance.
					</p>
					<br>
					<figure class="centered_image">
						<div>
							<img class="" src="img/sign.png" alt="Pic of my curvy thick ass signature">
						</div>

						<figcaption><i><b>My curvy thick signature</i></b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br>
					<p>
						But then I decided to modify it a little bit to make it different from my real signature. I
						removed the loop of the first letter Ayin. I added
						one point in the loop which corresponds to the point of letters Ba and Jim at the same time. The
						tail of the first letter Dal makes actually the stroke of letter Ya.
					</p>

					<br>
					<figure class="centered_image">
						<div>
							<img class="" src="svg/signrmx.svg" alt="Few tries of my logo as a remix of my signature">
						</div>
						<figcaption><i><b>Some handwritten tries of my remixed signature</i></b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br>
					<p>
						Eventhough the logo as above may be nice by having that handwritten Arabic calligraphy vibes,
						but I felt that because of how it looks,
						it seems that it could be difficult to incorporate it into a website with a corresponding Latin
						font charter.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, I decided to drop the idea of making my signature as a logo for my website and decided to
						explore other ways.
						In order to make the logo more affordable to integrate it into a website, I decided to make it
						thicker and more angular.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>I did this :</p>
					<br>
					<figure class="centered_image">
						<div>
							<img class="" src="svg/bizarre.svg" alt="Strange logo">
						</div>
						<figcaption><i><b>It is written Al-Majid from down in the middle to left, making a 360°
									loop</i></b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br>
					<p>
						I tried making something looking like a shield or an emblem and at the same time my name on it.
						Because of how the letters are not that recognisable, I droped it...
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						But I didn't drop the idea of making something bold and angular. How about writing my name
						completely with a thick typography but maybe obliquely ?
					</p>
					<br>
					<figure class="centered_image">
						<div>
							<img class="" src="svg/customfontlogo.svg" alt="fullname logo">
						</div>
						<figcaption><i><b>Custom typography from bold to thin and regular to italic</i></b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br>
					<p>
						I designed first my name written in an oblique and thick way (bottom right corner of the image
						above). From this, I did the other experiments.
						The typography looks cool and the first attempt is actually the coolest but I gave up keeping
						this idea as a logo because I found it to be too simple for its purpose.
						There is nothing special in it into making it a whole logo.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Finally, with some research and perseverance, I designed the definitive logo. Indeed, this is
						the one you encountered first when you entered my website.
						The logo is thick, squarish and does look like a real square kufic calligraphy.
					</p>
					<br>

					<figure class="centered_image">
						<div>
							<img style="filter: invert(100%);" class="" src="svg/logo_alt.svg"
								alt="that logo">
						</div>
						<figcaption><i><b>My current logo following square kufic calligraphy style</i></b>
						</figcaption>

					</figure>
					<br>

					<p>
						I went with old school arabic letters which is without points, as you may notice, in order to make the logo compact. 
					</p>
					<p>
						You may now wonder how to read my name in this logo. There is two part in my name Abd, below, and Al-Majid above as follow :
					</p>
					<br>
					<table  class="centered_image">
						<tr>
							<td>
								<figure class="centered_image">
									<div>
										<img class="" src="svg/abd.svg"
											alt="that logo">
									</div>
								</figure>
							</td>
							<td>
								<figure class="centered_image">
									<div>
										<img class="" src="svg/almajid.svg"
											alt="that logo">
									</div>
								</figure>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><figcaption><i><b>Abd</i></b></figcaption></td>
							<td><figcaption><i><b>Al-Majid</i></b></figcaption></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<br>
					<p>
						Abd part is pretty straight forward to read :
						<ul>
							<li style="color:rgb(0,0,255)">Blue is Ain</li>
							<li style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Red is Ba</li>
							<li style="color:rgb(0, 255, 0)">Green is Dal</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Al-Majid in the other hand is a bit trickier. It involves the mirroring of letters Ya (unchanged though) and Dal (which makes it looks similar to Ain) because the writing
						of these letters went from left to right after letter Jim.
						<ul>
							<li style="color:rgb(0,0,255)">Blue is Alif</li>
							<li style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Red is Lam</li>
							<li style="color:rgb(0, 255, 0)">Green is Mim</li>
							<li style="color:rgb(255, 191, 0)">Yellow is Jim</li>
							<li style="color:rgb(123, 63, 0)">Brown is Ya</li>
							<li style="color:rgb(137, 137, 137)">Grey is Dal</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						If you are a westerner, there's a chance that you can't read my logo and think it is a maze... I hope now that the explanation makes it clear for you!

					Arcaduo : my unreleased mobilphone game
				</h2>
				<hr>
				<div class="section_content">
					<p>In 2018, I designed and conceived an originally fun mobile game called ARCADUO.</p>
					<br>
					<figure class="centered_image">
						<img class="" src="img/arcaduo_title.png" alt="Arcaduo typo title logo">
						<figcaption><i><b>ARCADUO typographic logo</i></b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br>
					<p>
						In fact it is not just one game, it is a groupe of multiple games playable and only playable with a partner on the same device. ARCADUO app emphasise on the social aspect 
						of gaming which is playing with your parents, your siblings, or your friends, with someone you know or don't know, face to face ; in other term, having a direct interaction with your mate which is actually funny
						and unusual at the same time on a small piece of device such as a tablet or, even smaller, a mobile phone.  
					</p>
					<br>
					<figure class="centered_image">
						<img class="" src="img/arcaduo_logo.png" alt="Arcaduo emblem">
						<figcaption><i><b>ARCADUO emblem, a heart and a thunder</i></b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br>
					<p>
						You may now wonder why the logo is like such above and what is the meaning of a heart and a thunder in a game like this. Right ?
						<br>
						In fact, this is the essance of Arcaduo, each game has two modes : Solidarity mode and Rivalry one. In Solidarity mode, the two players team up together to get the bestt score
						they can ; while in Rivalry mode one, players confront each other in a versus mode.

						<figcaption><i><b>ARCADUO gameplay footage</i></b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br>
					<p>
						I aimed this game to be played by casual gamers, those who don't try hard games like kids and grandmas. This is why, as you noticed in the video above, I prefered to bring a simplistic
						flat design with simple geometrical shapes with cheerful colors.

						During the day of projects presentation in my University (<a href="https://jdp.esiee.fr/">ESIEE's JDP</a>), I noticed that Arcaduo on my stand 
						got mainly the attention of girls who enjoyed a lot the concept, which I didn't expect. The explanation to this is maybe because of its social aspect 
						of the game : playing together on the same screen is nicer than playing alone on the screen online like boys nowadays. The second explanation to this 
						could be the design choice and cheerful colors.

					My music sequencer : C0deTracker

				<hr>
				<div class="section_content">
					<p>
						<a href="https://github.com/ABD-Z/C0deTracker/tree/perf_CinT" target="_blank"> C0deTracker</a> is my sound, music sequencer (or tracker) written in C++ allowing you, the user,
						to design and compose sound/music in your C++ program. An audio API is needed though to record sound or play that latter in real time.

							<img class="" src="img/codetracker.png" alt="logo of C0deTracker">

						<figcaption><i><b>The logo and its typography designed by my hands.<br>Note that C-0 means, in trackers world, 
							the first note (Do or C) of the first octave of a piano</i></b></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br>
					<p>
						I were into music tracking since long time with Famitracker, then Deflemask and enjoyed a lot, and still enjoy, old school music tracking hardware in general.
					</p><br>
					<p>But the story of C0deTracker began recently in 2020 when I was doing a test from N.E.R.D (Nintendo European Research and Development) on ShaderToy, which is a website allowing people to write
						and render shaders (fragment or pixel shader to be more specific) online. The aim of the exercice they gave me to do was to render a black hole with ray tracing (which I partially succeeded, 
						but got rejected due to the fact that I didn't make a true physical simulation of the phenomenon). I noticed some shaders, made by other people on the platform that you can view,
						can also render audio. This gave me the motivation to make my generated real time music. With the few knowledge I have in signal processing and FM/AM (Frequency Modulation/Amplitude Modulation) I could
						create PSG (Pulse Sound Generator) based instruments and also FM. In short, the shader that I have done for Nintendo was somehow the origin of C0deTracker.<br>
						You can play with my shader <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tljyRc" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
						<b>BEWARE : </b> ShaderToy may appear to be too heavy for your computer, it takes a lot of time to compile, don't worrry.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						For now, COdeTracker is cool to make NES like music, and way more.<br>C0deTracker is great to integrate in a video game project, for example, where all of your audios
						are hard coded in your game and generated at real time. I used C0deTracker for my last two <a href="#my_game_jams_games">game jams</a>.

			<h1>Why design matters ? </h1> <br>
			<p>
				Design is <b>fundamental</b> in our every days life.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is the <b>form</b> from which the <b>substance</b> of ideas is conveyed through objects whether
				it could be an article, a logo brand, a packaging, a pencil, a bowl, a fork... Everything!
			</p>
			<p>In simpler words, a <b>design is how something looks and works</b>.</p>
			<p>
				So, making the <b>user's experience</b> of the product <b>enjoyable</b> is the <b>goal number one</b> of
				a <b>good designer</b>.
				A designer <b>MUST NEVER EVER</b> forget his target in mind : the final user.
